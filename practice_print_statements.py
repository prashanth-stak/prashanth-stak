# what is string ?
# String is a colection of alphabets, words or numbers or combination of any which are declared inside double quotes or a single quote
#example

str2 = "1234"                 #collection of numbers
str3 = "python123"            #collection of combination of numbers and alphabets(alphanumerics)
