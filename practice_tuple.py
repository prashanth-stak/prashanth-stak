# What is tuple?
# A group of elements which is of string or number or combination of both and enclosed by (). Tuple is immutable.

# differences between list and tuple
#   List                                                    Tuple
# list is mutable                                          Tuple is immutable
# appending and extending can be done                      Append and extend cannot be performed
# it has more memory space                                 it consumes less memory space
# list is slow                                             tuple is fast
